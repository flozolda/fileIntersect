# file_intersect

Deletes all files in folder 2 that don't exist in folder 1.

My use case: Camera creates jpgs and raws and when filtering
I only want to go through one of them and make sure that the raw files are filtered as well

## How to use (currently):
Run code and add the paths to the 2 folders.

Easiest => Drag the code to the parent directory of the 2 folders

## TODO: 

- Make an actual intersection
- Add modes via cmd arguments
